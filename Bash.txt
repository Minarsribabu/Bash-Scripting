--monitering liog files(Devops job, we have to moniter the log files which are updated in 24hrs)

firstly the log files show the information about Success/Failures/Errors/Fatals so we need to check those by using
	"grep "Failure" *.log"
	-grep used to search/categorize in the files
	-here we are finiding the failure text in *.log files

	find . -name *.log -mtime -1 (find for filtering, . represents current Directory(here logs is the directory),-name to display the filtered files by names of the each files,:wq *.log all files which are with .log extension, -mtime for filtering time, -1 means before 1 day/1 day back edited)
